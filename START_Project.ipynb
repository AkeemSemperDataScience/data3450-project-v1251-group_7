    "### Detailed Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> You need one model per person. Decide on a slightly different approach for each person - you can change things like varaibles used, preparation, Regression or Bayes models, and othe things like that.</li>\n",
    "<li> For each model, you must: </li>\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "    <li> Create a predictive model. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Evaluate its performance. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Create a markdown cell that explains your model choice and evaluation. </li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "<li> Overall, as a team, your team will select the best model from the selection. </li>\n",
    "<li> <b> This needs to be in one workbook, containing: </b></li>\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "    <li> Initial data exploration/preparation from original data to 'ready for modeling'. Any preparation that is <b>common</b> to everyone should go here. Exact details will vary, but you want to explore the data visually as well as numerically. Focus on stuff that impacted decisions - what did you find in the data that caused you to take action or make a different choice? </li>\n",
    "    <li> A markdown cell that briefly explains, ideally mostly in point form, what you found whilst exploring and what preparation you needed to do. Based on those findings, what are the different model approaches?</li>\n",
    "    <li> Each person's model, evaluation, and explanation in their own section. </li>\n",
    "    <li> An overall conclusion of what was best and how well it worked. Present your results in some kind of visualization. </li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "<li><b> In the workbook, please have the code that you settled on to explore, clean, model, and evaluate. In the explaination cells, give a brief explaination of what you did and how you got to what you settled on. </b> </li>\n",
    "<li> In the data preparation, consider statistics stuff. Things such as transformations may be worth a try. </li>\n",
    "<li> You don't need to spent an eternity tuning the models to get amazing results, we will worry more about that later. Make N reasonable choices on an approach to take based on what the data looks like, do the appropriate preparation, test the models, and observe the results. <b>The raw accuracy scores don't matter, only the approach.</b> </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the workbook should clearly show what happened - you exlored the data, made some general processing steps, decided on different approaches based on what you found, created models according to each approach (model specific exploration/prep, model creation, evaluation), and an overall conclusion summarising what you found and what you would try next if you were to continue testing. In doing the data exploration especially, it is pretty normal to have several iterations of exploring and cleaning data - for example, you might add a filter for an outlier, look at a pair plot, adjust the filter, look at a pair plot, add another filter, look at a pair plot, and so on. Please don't show this literal process step by step, condense it down to what matters - something like, \"here's the distributions, we did these outlier filters and removed these two features, here's the result\", then continuing on. Basically, illustrate what happened and why, but not all of the back and forth or deliberation that went into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> I said that you can try Bayes as well; it isn't mandatory, but feel free. If you do, you'll need to likely do a little reading on the details of exactly what to use, there are a few variations on Bayes that aren't just 'Bayes' and you'll need to select. The documentation has a pretty good explainer (it is generally linkined in the 'user guide' link of each model's documentaion page, or google \"sklearn naive bayes\"), and things work more or less the same, you just need to meet the requirements of the specific model you choose.\n",

    "<b>Note:</b> The feature set is mixed, meaning there are both categorical and numerical variables present in the dataset. <b>Mixed featureds generally require different processing. We haven't done the tool that mixes these easily yet, that's fine and ok, we have stats instead. Right now, there are several decisions you can make to use both the numerical and categorical data together, think about how to represent the data and some of the options we have available for transformations.</b> This is part of what you want to figure out while exploring the data - you have a constraint on your ability to use mixed feature sets, yet you must use the data you <i>do</i> have, along with the different processing choices you can make, to create a model. Again, you are testing a few approaches against each other, the idea isn't to pick the best approach off the top of your head, it's to make reasonable attempts to narrow down what works best. This isn't a trick for one specific action, there's a bunch of things you can do that are reasonable. Later, we'll automate some of this, so we can try more things to work towards the 'best' model."
